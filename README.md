# 💘 Valentine's Website

A fun and simple Valentine's Day website built to ask one important question:  
**"Will you be my valentine?"**

This project is intentionally lightweight and playful, designed to look like it 
was made in a day using only basic web technologies.

## 🌈 How It Works

- The No button is positioned absolutely and moves to a random location whenever
 the user tries to hover over it.                                               - The Yes button redirects the user to yes.html.
- The celebration page uses basic CSS and JavaScript to create falling confetti 
and balloons.
